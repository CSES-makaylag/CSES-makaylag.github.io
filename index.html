                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I want to be remembered as someone who
                     always put her all into making everyone feel included.
                      When I was younger, I was used to being left out of certain 
                      moments and ended up taking them to heart. Within my career 
                      field, Iâ€™m certain that I'll make a way for everyone to 
                      feel like they have a voice in whatever the work field has 
                      in store for us. </p>
